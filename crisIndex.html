         var welcome = "Hello and welcome to the muon g-2 experiment! What’s muon g-2, you ask? Keep on reading to find out! If you already know a few things about particle physics, click >>here<< for some extra detail. You can always use the toggle at the top of the page to switch back to whatever description you like best! Have fun!"
          
         <!––Overview/Intro--->
         var scientist1 = "The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon to an unprecedented precision. This is strongly motivated by the previous measurements at Brookhaven National Lab which resulted in a discrepancy with the current theoretical model, known as the Standard Model of particle physics. Several models beyond the Standard Model have been proposed to explain the discrepancy but improvements from both theory and experiment are needed to constrain the various models."
         var layman1 = "About 30 miles west of Chicago, scientists working at the particle physics laboratory known as Fermilab are running a groundbreaking experiment, called Muon g-2. Particle physics aims to understand the smallest building blocks of matter which make up our world. There are dozens of active particle physics experiments all over the planet, studying all sorts of phenomena that can tell us about the fundamental nature of the universe. What is the true nature of gravity? Are there extra dimensions beyond the three we experience? How did the universe begin? The answers to deep and fundamental questions such as these are the targets of particle physics research. Much of the research has supported a theory known as the Standard Model, which has successfully explained most all experimental results since its development in the 1970s and is our best to-date understanding of the fundamental particles and forces in the universe. However, our understanding is not complete and neither is the Standard Model. There are mysteries yet unexplained by its rules, and it’s possible physicists may need to look to a new theory altogether to answer some of the toughest questions. What does all this have to do with an experiment near Chicago? Muon g-2 will be a more sensitive test of the Standard Model than any previous experiment of its kind."
         
         <!––What is a muon?--->
        var scientist2 = "A muon is a subatomic particle, believed to be elementary. It is similar to the electron in that it has an electric charge of -1 and interacts similarly to the electron. However, the muon has a mass of about 200 times that of the electron. Additionally, it is unstable, meaning it will decay after 2.2 microseconds (on average). Electrons, on the other hand, are stable and have a lifetime of at least 10^28 years (much greater than the age of the universe!). Muon decay almost always produces at least three particles, which must include an electron and two neutrinos of different types."
        var layman2 = "A muon is a fundamental subatomic particle, which means that it is smaller than an atom and, as far as we know, it cannot be broken down into smaller particles. In contrast to the electron, which is a constituent of the atoms which make up all matter, the muon is a bit heavy, weighing in at a mass of about 200 times that of the electron. Additionally, it is unstable, meaning it will decay after an average of 2.2 microseconds, while the stable electron sticks around for yottayears (a very long time). Even though muons do not make up the ordinary matter of our bodies, food, homes, etc, hundreds of muons from cosmic rays pass through your body every second. It may sound like muons are exotic and evasive but it turns out they have just the right properties for testing the Standard Model!"

        <!––More about muons--->
         var scientist3 = "Text One"
        var layman3 = "Every minute, roughly 10,000 muons reach every square meter of the earth’s surface as a result of collisions between cosmic rays and particles in the upper atmosphere. In fact, muons were discovered in 1936 during a study of cosmic radiation. One of the scientists noticed particles that curved differently from electrons and other known particles when passed through a magnetic field. They were negatively charged but curved less sharply than electrons, but more sharply than protons, for particles of the same velocity. It was assumed that the magnitude of their negative electric charge was equal to that of the electron, and so to account for the difference in curvature, it was supposed that their mass was greater than an electron but smaller than a proton. Much like the process that occurs when muons shower down from cosmic ray collisions, we make muons in the lab by colliding high energy protons with a target (e.g. beryllium). This high energy interaction between the incoming protons and the target protons or neutrons produces particles known as pions (π). Pions have an average lifetime of 26 ns, after which they decay to muons."
