         var welcome = "Hello and welcome to the muon g-2 experiment! What’s muon g-2, you ask? Keep on reading to find out! If you already know a few things about particle physics, click >>here<< for some extra detail. You can always use the toggle at the top of the page to switch back to whatever description you like best! Have fun!"
          
         <!––Overview/Intro--->
         var scientist1 = "The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon to an unprecedented precision. This is strongly motivated by the previous measurements at Brookhaven National Lab which resulted in a discrepancy with the current theoretical model, known as the Standard Model of particle physics. Several models beyond the Standard Model have been proposed to explain the discrepancy but improvements from both theory and experiment are needed to constrain the various models."
         var layman1 = "About 30 miles west of Chicago, scientists working at the particle physics laboratory known as Fermilab are running a groundbreaking experiment, called Muon g-2. Particle physics aims to understand the smallest building blocks of matter which make up our world. There are dozens of active particle physics experiments all over the planet, studying all sorts of phenomena that can tell us about the fundamental nature of the universe. What is the true nature of gravity? Are there extra dimensions beyond the three we experience? How did the universe begin? The answers to deep and fundamental questions such as these are the targets of particle physics research. Much of the research has supported a theory known as the Standard Model, which has successfully explained most all experimental results since its development in the 1970s and is our best to-date understanding of the fundamental particles and forces in the universe. However, our understanding is not complete and neither is the Standard Model. There are mysteries yet unexplained by its rules, and it’s possible physicists may need to look to a new theory altogether to answer some of the toughest questions. What does all this have to do with an experiment near Chicago? Muon g-2 will be a more sensitive test of the Standard Model than any previous experiment of its kind."
         
         <!––What is a muon?--->
        var scientist2 = "A muon is a subatomic particle, believed to be elementary. It is similar to the electron in that it has an electric charge of -1 and interacts similarly to the electron. However, the muon has a mass of about 200 times that of the electron. Additionally, it is unstable, meaning it will decay after 2.2 microseconds (on average). Electrons, on the other hand, are stable and have a lifetime of at least 10^28 years (much greater than the age of the universe!). Muon decay almost always produces at least three particles, which must include an electron and two neutrinos of different types."
        var layman2 = "A muon is a fundamental subatomic particle, which means that it is smaller than an atom and, as far as we know, it cannot be broken down into smaller particles. In contrast to the electron, which is a constituent of the atoms which make up all matter, the muon is a bit heavy, weighing in at a mass of about 200 times that of the electron. Additionally, it is unstable, meaning it will decay after an average of 2.2 microseconds, while the stable electron sticks around for yottayears (a very long time). Even though muons do not make up the ordinary matter of our bodies, food, homes, etc, hundreds of muons from cosmic rays pass through your body every second. It may sound like muons are exotic and evasive but it turns out they have just the right properties for testing the Standard Model!"

        <!––Where do muons come from?--->
        var scientist3 = "Muons are created from pion decays which generally occur as a product of hadron collisions, e.g. cosmic rays with particles in the atmosphere. The favored decay mode of the pion results in a muon and muon neutrino. (It’s also possible for the pion to decay into an electron and electron neutrino but this is less likely. And if the original pion is electrically neutral, it can decay into photons.)
Since muons created from cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere are imbued with the high energy of their parent particles, relativistic effects allow them to make it to the earth’s surface before decaying. Such muons are also minimum ionizing particles, which means they lose very little energy on their journey to Earth and often penetrate deep into Earth's surface before decaying."
         
        var layman3 = "In general, muons are created as a result of collisions and interactions between other subatomic particles. Every minute, roughly 10,000 muons reach every square meter of the earth’s surface as a result of collisions between cosmic rays and particles in the upper atmosphere. Cosmic rays are high-energy nuclei of different atoms, mostly nuclei of hydrogen atoms which are simply single protons.
In fact, muons were discovered in 1936 during a study of cosmic radiation. One of the scientists noticed particles that curved differently from electrons and other known particles when passed through a magnetic field. They were negatively charged but curved less sharply than electrons, but more sharply than protons, for particles of the same velocity. 
Since muons created from cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere are imbued with the high energy of their parent particles, relativistic effects allow them to make it to the earth’s surface before decaying. Had the muon been puttering around at a speed much less than the speed of light (67 million mph!), it would have a lifetime of 2.2 microseconds. However, moving at a speed near the speed of light (aka 'relativistically'), causes an effect known as time dilation to occur and the free lifetime increases by some factor which depends on the speed of the particle. A muon moving at 99.99% the speed of light will live ~293 times longer than a slow muon.
Such muons are also minimum ionizing particles, which means they lose very little energy on their journey to Earth and often penetrate deep into Earth's surface before decaying."

        <!––How do we make muons?--->
        var scientist4 = "Much like the process that occurs when muons shower down from cosmic ray collisions, we make muons in the lab by colliding high energy protons with a target (e.g. beryllium). This high energy interaction between the incoming protons and the target protons or neutrons produces particles known as pions (π). Pions have an average lifetime of 26 ns, after which they decay to muons. These muons can then be funneled into a beamline which directs them to their experiment."

        <!––An aside about Magnets?--->
        var scientist5 = "Text One"
        var layman5 = "Text Two"
        
         <!––magnetic moment--->
        var scientist6 = "The magnetic dipole moment of an object is a measure of the object's tendency to align with a magnetic field. It is a vector quantity, with the positive direction defined by the way the object responds to a magnetic field: The object will tend to align itself so that its magnetic moment vector is parallel to the magnetic field lines."
        var layman6 = "The magnetic moment of a magnet is a quantity that determines the torque (rotational force) it will experience in an external magnetic field. A loop of electric current, a bar magnet, an electron, a molecule, and a planet all have magnetic moments as they are all magnets. A greater magnetic moment means a greater tendency to rotate into alignment with external fields. An object with no magnetic moment is not magnetic and would be unaffected by the presence of an external magnetic field. 
Subatomic particles, such as muons, have a magnetic moment that arises from their spin. Spin is an intrinsic form of angular momentum. For a macroscopic rotating object, such as the earth or a top, the angular momentum is determined by how the object rotates around its central axis. For an elementary particle, which we consider to be point-like, we can use this analogy to get some intuition about spin but it’s not entirely accurate. Point particles have no spatial extension and therefore cannot rotate about an internal axis. Therefore, the type of angular momentum known as spin is a purely intrinsic and static quantity like mass or charge. "
        
        <!––anomalous magnetic moment--->
        var scientist7 = "Quantum mechanical effects contribute to the magnetic moment such that it is slightly different than what we would expect in an non-quantum approximation. This small deviation is called the anomaly. Specifically, the anomaly comes from loop contributions to the main process. "
        var layman7 = "The magnetic moment of the muon characterizes the rotation of the muon spin in an external magnetic field. A charged particle has a magnetic moment that arises from its spin. Using classical reasoning, we can treat the charged particle as a rotating piece of current and derive an equation for the magnetic moment. But due to the point-like nature of elementary particles, this treatment doesn’t quite work. By taking a quantum mechanical point of view, we discover that for spin-½ particles, such as the muon, there is an additional factor of 2 tacked on to the equation for the magnetic moment. This factor is known as the g-factor. What we find out, however, is this is not the full story either. There are more corrections to be made….talk about vacuum, loops, etc...
Today the anomaly includes contributions from many physics processes, in addition to Schwinger’s original lowest order diagram.
"
        
        <!––who cares--->
        var scientist8 = "The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces in the universe (the electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear interactions), as well as classifying all known elementary particles. Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. Thus physicists must find ways of investigating any cracks in the theory in order to find new answers to old questions.
The Muon g−2 Experiment will measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment, aµ ≡ (g − 2)/2, to unprecedented precision: the goal is 0.14 parts per million (ppm). The worth of such an undertaking is coupled to the fact that the Standard Model (SM) prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can also be determined to similar precision. As such, the comparison between experiment and theory provides one of the most sensitive tests of the completeness of the model."
        var layman8 = "forthcoming"
        
         <!––how does it work--->
        var scientist9 = "Muons are injected into a storage ring which provides the magnetic field required to keep the muons in orbit until they decay. When a muon does finally decay, one of its decay products will be an electron. The electron, being less massive than the muon, will not be able to stay in orbit and its trajectory will curve inward, where there are detectors. These detectors will measure the energy and time of the decay electrons that land there. As it turns out, the energy of the decay electron is correlated to the magnetic moment of the parent muon at the time of decay. Thus by collecting this information on the electrons, we can learn how the magnetic moment of the muon is precessing as it goes around the ring."
